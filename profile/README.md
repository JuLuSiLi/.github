# :wave: This is us!

We are five and long-term friends from Germany with a common interest in programming.
Together, we work on all sorts of projects, whenever we have a "nice idea" over one or two beers.

We hope you find these projects interesting or useful, because we surely do!

Feel free to browse for a while and maybe you'll find something you like!

## About Us

Our interests are vast and diverse and in -- what we believe -- an ideal combination.

Some of us are interested in DevOps and automation, some of us are skilled programmers,
others are realistic and plan everything through, and some are artsy.

All in all, a quite good combination to create awesomeness!
